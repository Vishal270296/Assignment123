    "1.\tWhat is the primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in a way that promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of code. OOP achieves this by organizing data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) into objects and classes, allowing for the creation of self-contained, reusable, and easily extensible code"

    "2.\tWhat is an object in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:In Python, an object is an instance of a class. It is a self-contained unit that combines data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). Objects are created from classes and can have unique values for their attributes while sharing the same methods defined in the class."

    "\n",
    "Solution:In Python, a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects of that class. A class can have attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that define the data and operations associated with the objects created from the class."

    "\n",
    "Solution:Attributes in a class represent the data or properties of objects. They are variables that store information about the object's state. Methods, on the other hand, are functions defined within a class that define the behavior or actions that objects of that class can perform."

    "\n",
    "Solution:The main difference between class variables and instance variables in Python is their scope and where they are defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Class variables are defined at the class level and are shared by all instances of the class. They are the same for all objects created from that class.\n",
    "2) Instance variables are specific to each instance of the class. They are defined within methods and store unique data for each object"

    "\n",
    "Solution: The self parameter in Python class methods refers to the instance of the class itself. It allows you to access and manipulate the instance's attributes and methods. When you call a method on an instance, Python automatically passes the instance as the first argument (usually named self) so that you can work with its data"
