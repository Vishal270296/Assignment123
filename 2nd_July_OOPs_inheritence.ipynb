    "1.\tExplain what inheritance is in object-oriented programming and why it is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows one class (called the derived or subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) of another class (called the base or superclass). It is used to establish a hierarchy of classes, where derived classes can reuse and extend the functionality of base classes. Inheritance promotes code reuse, modularity, and the creation of specialized classes based on existing ones.\n",

    "\n",
    "Solution: Single Inheritance vs. Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, a derived class can inherit from only one base class. This means that each class has a single parent class. Single inheritance is simpler and less prone to ambiguity but may limit flexibility in certain situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Inheritance: In multiple inheritance, a derived class can inherit from more than one base class. This allows for greater flexibility but can lead to issues like the \"diamond problem\" where ambiguity arises when two base classes have a method with the same name. Multiple inheritance is more complex and requires careful handling.\n"

    "\n",
    "Solution: Base Class (Superclass or Parent Class): The base class is the class whose attributes and methods are inherited by other classes. It provides a template for derived classes.\n",

    "4.\tWhat is the significance of the \"protected\" access modifier in inheritance? How does it differ from \"private\" and \"public\" modifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Solutin: \"Protected\" Access Modifier: In many programming languages, including Python, \"protected\" is a visibility modifier that indicates that an attribute or method is not intended to be accessed directly from outside the class, but it can still be accessed by derived classes. It is denoted by a single underscore prefix (e.g., _protected_var). In contrast:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Private\" members are denoted with double underscores (e.g., __private_var) and are not directly accessible from outside the class.\n",
    "\"Public\" members have no special notation and are accessible from anywhere.\n",
    "The use of \"protected\" allows derived classes to access and modify certain attributes or methods, maintaining a level of encapsulation while allowing for inheritance."

    "5.What is the purpose of the \"super\" keyword in inheritance? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"super\" Keyword in Inheritance: The \"super\" keyword is used in inheritance to call a method from the parent (base) class within the context of the child (derived) class. It is commonly used when a derived class wants to extend or override a method from the base class while still utilizing the functionality of the base class's method. Here's an example:"
